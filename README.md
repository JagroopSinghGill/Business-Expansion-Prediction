# Business-Expansion-Prediction
Now days, most of the
information published on the Web is
published on social media platforms and
represented through social networks such
as Facebook or Twitter, to name only the
main ones. Startup companies are flooding
the Information Technology market day
by day.2018 holds a lot of challenges for
business growth and expansion, and smart
CEOs and investors should position
themselves for a highly volatile year.
Companies are looking up for their
business expansion for better revenue.
Companies do a lot of analysis on customer
feedback but it is not sufficient enough to
gather sufficient information to decide
where to put their next checkpoints. A
better and responsive system is required to
suggest new location based on user
experience on social webs. It will save a
huge amount of time and work required to
store and process a large number of user
feedback and reviews. Our system is based
on peopleâ€™s tweets. Data mining from
twitter and plot then on a map scanning
through an algorithm and find out the user
interest in company and based on that
suggesting a new location to the company
to expand their business. It is will help the organizations to predict
the best location for the product to launch.
